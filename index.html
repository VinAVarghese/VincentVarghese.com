        <p class="col-sm-6">A Full Stack Developer leveraging over five years of management experience to successfully provide clients with effective and innovative products. With a full-stack development certificate from the University of Washington, I am well-learned in skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. My bachelor's degree with a leadership focus has also allowed me to manage communications of the non-profit Vision Rescue and then progress in the medical management field with CityMD. At Vision Rescue, I successfully established a new on-field reporting system that helped me create regular newsletters, presentations, and web content for global distribution to current and prospective partners. In my progressive medical management experience at CityMD, I was able to not only facilitate incredible Press Ganey scores at my clinics but cultivate a loyal patient and staff base who were committed through a company transition. Ultimately, I am a contagiously joyful worker, driven by the desire to create meaningful tools and products for clients while cultivating healthy team dynamics.</p>
