        <p class="col-sm-8"><span class="firstcharacter">A</span> Full Stack Developer leveraging over five years of management experience to successfully provide clients with effective and innovative products. With a full-stack development certificate from the University of Washington, I am well-learned in skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. With a bachelor's degree focusing in leadership, I have successfully managed communications for the non-profit Vision Rescue and have had a progressive medical management career with CityMD. 
        <br><br>
        At Vision Rescue, I successfully established a new on-field reporting system that helped me create regular newsletters, presentations, and web content for global distribution to current and prospective partners. In my progressive medical management experience at CityMD, I was able to not only facilitate incredible Press Ganey scores at my clinics but cultivate a loyal patient and staff base who were committed through a company transition.
        <br><br> 
        Ultimately, I am a contagiously joyful worker, driven by the desire to create meaningful tools and products for clients while cultivating healthy team dynamics.</p>
